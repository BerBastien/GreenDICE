README

For building and running the GreeDICE model you need to first install the Mimi Framework in Julia Language, more info here: https://github.com/mimiframework/

Once Mimi is working, run the file 'GreenDICE.jl' to build the GreenDICE model

Run the file 'Run_GreenDICE.jl' to run the GreenDICE model under the specifications: 'main GreenDICE', 'All use values', and 'Market only'

To enable Asset Investments in GreenDICE run the file 'GreenDICE_AssetInvestment.jl' and then 'Run_GreenDICE_AssetInvestment.jl'

To enable the Damage Reductions in GreenDICE run the file 'GreenDICE_DamageReduction.jl' and then 'Run_GreenDICE_DamageReduction.jl'

To plot the results run 'GreenDICE_plots.r' in R

The code will be cleaned up soon.
