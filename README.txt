README

For building and running the GreeDICE model you need to first install the Mimi Framework in Julia Language, more info here: https://github.com/mimiframework/

Once Mimi is working, run the file 'GreenDICE_main.jl', (it will take a while due to the Monte Carlo analysis and sensitivity analysis) 

To plot the results run 'GreenDICE_plots.r' in R
